## Description

GoogleBooksSearch is a React application that allows a user to search for book titles using the Google Books API. By entering a search term, the API will retrun a list of book results. The user can view or save any of the rendered books results that will include a link to the information of the book as well as the description, title, authors and image. The user is able to save a book that will be stored in a remote database, allowing them to view a page of their saved book and delete any of the saved books.

## Installation
